                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm an electronic music artist based in Dresden, creating and performing ambient and dub techno
                    music. Most of the inspirations for my music come from travelling. My music are musically memories
                    about my journeys using tones of analog synthesizers, sounds from my modular system, endless echoes
                    and warm reverbs. In 2018 I released my full-lenght Atacama. I call it music for travelling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The roots of my music are somewhere between dub and detroit techno, inspired by artists like Basic
                    Channel or Maurizio. My aim is to transform dub techno in an up-to-date audio frame, ranging from
                    spheric and hypnotic to rough and driven.

            <article aria-label="Etui Records">
                <h2>Etui Records</h2>
                <p>
                    The label is an artistic playground and community for a wide range of artists such as Monomood, El
                    Choop or Andrea Cichecki and ofcourse my own musically works. With Etui Winter Camp compilation
                    series the label also features ambient music. The discography includes more then 50 releases on
                    vinyl and digital audio.

                    In the mid 90s Dresden was beside Berlin the epi center of techno culture in East Germany.
                    The city was full of semi legal underground venues and djs from Berlin to Detroit played every
                    weekend. The venue Flugzeugwerft was part of this culture. It was also the place where I played my
                    first live shows. After the venue closed its doos in 1998 I founded the label Etui Records to
                    release my music on vinyl.

                <h2>Photography and Filming</h2>
                <p>
                    Beside my music, I also share a big passion for photography and video filming. Most of the artworks
                    for the label are based on my photos. The photo for the cover artwork of Atacama I took while
                    traveling from the Salar de Uyuni to San Pedro de Atacama. The inside of the gatefold cover is based
                    on a photo I shot in La Paz overlooking the Bolivean capital at night.

                    Since I was in the 6th grade at school I am fascinated by making videos. For my music videos I
                    mostly capture the nature. In the cutting process of the video production I try to find video
                    snippets that visually reflect the sounds. For tracks like Forest Of The Monkeys or Wanderlust I
                    also used the recorded audio of the video for sounds in my music.

                <h2>Workshops for DAVE Festival</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2014 I co-founded DAVE Festival in Dresden. For the Festival I organize workshops about music
                    production and technology, a label market and different audio visual concerts. Together with musican
                    Kabuki and visual artist highpitchedblack we started DAVE Live Jam and invited Dresden musicans and
                    visual artists to bring there gear for an improvisional live show.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DAVE Festival stands for Dresden Audio Visual Experience. It takes place between October and
                    November. The festival was established after a fire at Fat Fenders Recordstore. The aim is
                    to bring together newcomer and well established artists from Dresden and from all over the world.
                    But its not only about dancing. Another aim is the support of the local electronic music scene by
                    providing a wide range of program like workshops, panel discussions or a label market.

                    Always wanting to enhance my skills I attended to FELD workshop with Ulf Langheinrich at ICAS
                    festival 2015. For DAVE Festival I organized DAVE Workshop Camp with Electric Indigo, Thomas
                    Wagensommerer and Robert Henke at University of Music in Dresden 2017 and 2018. In 2024 Hellerau -
                    Center of European Arts invited to a workshop about 3D scanning objects to find the <cite>digital

                    In 2022 I started studying media informatics at IU Internationale Hochschule. As part of my studies,
                    I did a project on user interface design for the DAVE Festival website. I also looked at the
                    influence of AI on music. For 2025 I am invited by Prof. Sibylle Kunze to write a book article on
                    <cite>How to Bandcamp, Spotify and YouTube - Basics of digital music distribution.</cite>
