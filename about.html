                    <article aria-label="Inspirations">
                        <p>
                            I am an electronic music artist living in Dresden, creating ambient and dub techno music.
                            Most of the inspiration for my music comes from travelling. My music are musical memories
                            about my travels with sounds from analogue synthesizers, sounds from my modular system,
                            endless echoes and warm reverbs. In 2018, I released my full-length album Atacama. I call it
                            music for travelling.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mtb-2">
                            The roots of my music lie somewhere between dub and Detroit techno, inspired by artists like
                            Basic Channel or Maurizio. My aim is to bring dub techno into a contemporary audio framework
                            that ranges from spherical and hypnotic to raw and driven.

                            The label is an artistic playground and community for a wide range of artists such as
                            Monomood, El Choop or Andrea Cichecki and ofcourse my own musical works. With Etui Winter

                            In the mid 90s Dresden was beside Berlin the epi center of techno culture in East Germany.
                            The city was full of semi legal underground venues and djs from Berlin to Detroit played
                            every weekend. The venue Flugzeugwerft was part of this culture. It was also the place where
                            I
                            played my first live shows. After the venue closed its doos in 1998 I founded the label Etui
                            Records
                            to release my music on vinyl.

                            Beside my music, I also share a big passion for photography and video filming. Most of the
                            artworks
                            for the label are based on my photos. The photo for the cover artwork of Atacama I took
                            while
                            traveling from the Salar de Uyuni to San Pedro de Atacama. The inside of the gatefold cover
                            is
                            based
                            on a photo I shot in La Paz overlooking the Bolivean capital at night.

                            Since I was in the 6th grade at school I am fascinated by making videos. For my music videos
                            I
                            mostly capture the nature. In the cutting process of the video production I try to find
                            video
                            snippets that visually reflect the sounds. For tracks like Forest Of The Monkeys or
                            Wanderlust I
                            also used the recorded audio of the video for sounds in my music.

                            DAVE Festival stands for Dresden Audio Visual Experience. It takes place between October and
                            November. The festival was established after a fire at Fat Fenders Recordstore. The aim is
                            to bring together newcomer and well established artists from Dresden and from all over the
                            world.
                            But its not only about dancing. Another aim is the support of the local electronic music
