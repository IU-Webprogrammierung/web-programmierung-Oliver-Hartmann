                        I am an electronic music artist living in Dresden, creating ambient and dub techno music.
                        Most of the inspirations for my music come from travelling. My music are musical memories
                        about my travels with sounds from analogue synthesizers, sounds from my modular system,
                        endless echoes and warm reverbs. In 2018, I released my full-length album <a
                            href="https://etui-records.bandcamp.com/album/atacama">Atacama.</a> I call it
                        music for travelling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The roots of my music lie somewhere between dub and Detroit techno, inspired by artists like
                        Basic Channel or Maurizio. My aim is to bring dub techno into a contemporary audio framework
                        that ranges from spherical and hypnotic to raw and driven.

                        The label is an artistic playground and community for a wide range of artists such as
                        Monomood, El Choop or Andrea Cichecki and ofcourse my own musical works. With Etui Winter
                        Camp compilation series the label also features ambient music. The discography includes more
                        then 50 releases on vinyl and digital audio.

                        In the mid 90s Dresden was beside Berlin the epi center of techno culture in East Germany.
                        The city was full of semi legal underground venues and djs from Berlin to Detroit played
                        every weekend. The venue Flugzeugwerft was part of this culture. It was also the place where
                        I played my first live shows. After the venue closed its doors in 1998 I founded the label to
                        release my music on vinyl.

                    <p>
                        Beside my music, I also share a big passion for photography and video filming. Most of the
                        artworks for the label are based on my photos. The photo for the cover artwork of Atacama I took
                        while traveling from the Salar de Uyuni to San Pedro de Atacama. The inside of the gatefold
                        cover is based on a photo I shot in La Paz overlooking the Bolivean capital at night.

                        Since I was in the 6th grade at school I am fascinated by making videos. For my music videos
                        I mostly capture the nature. In the cutting process of the video production I try to find
                        video snippets that visually reflect the sounds. For tracks like Forest Of The Monkeys or
                        Wanderlust I also used the recorded audio of the video for sounds in my music.

                        In 2014 I co-founded DAVE Festival in Dresden. For the Festival I organize workshops about
                        music production and technology, a label market and different audio visual concerts. Together
                        with musican Kabuki and visual artist highpitchedblack we started DAVE Live Jam and invited
                        Dresden musicans and visual artists to bring there gear for an improvisional live show.

                        DAVE Festival stands for Dresden Audio Visual Experience. It takes place between October and
                        November. The festival was established after a fire at Fat Fenders Recordstore. The aim is
                        to bring together newcomer and well established artists from Dresden and from all over the
                        world. But its not only about dancing. Another aim is the support of the local electronic music
                        scene by providing a wide range of program like workshops, panel discussions or a label market.

                        Always wanting to enhance my skills I attended to FELD workshop with Ulf Langheinrich at
                        ICAS festival 2015. For DAVE Festival I organized DAVE Workshop Camp with Electric Indigo,
                        Thomas Wagensommerer and Robert Henke at University of Music in Dresden 2017 and 2018. In 2024
                        Hellerau - Center of European Arts invited me to a workshop about 3D scanning objects using
                        LIDAR scanners to find the

                        In 2022 I started studying media informatics at IU Internationale Hochschule. As part of my
                        studies, I did a project on user interface design about DAVE Festival website. I also looked
                        at the influence of AI on music. For 2025 I am invited by Prof. Sibylle Kunze to write a book
                        article on <cite>How to Bandcamp, Spotify and YouTube - Basics of digital music
                            distribution.</cite> The book will be published on Springer / Gabler at the end of 2025.
