            <article>
                <p>
                    For the opening track “Sandstones” he used field recordings that he took at the sandstone mountains
                    of Saxony Switzerland National Park while hiking during the pandemic. Back in the studio he layered
                    it on top of spicy chords, beautiful pads and a shuffling groove. But it is this melancholic organ
                    that gives big emotions to the track.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second track is named after a famous little bass synthesizer. “Volca Dub” was recorded 10 years
                    ago. It was waiting on the hard drive for the perfect moment to get finished and released. The
                    chords of the Korg Volca Bass are heavily modulated and tranched into swirling tape delays with a
                    rumbling sub bass underneath. Just like dub should sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final track “Everlasting” he recorded live in one take on his modular synthesizer. It starts
                    with the rolling bassline by a Buchla inspired dual oscillator. A dreamy melody and melancholic
                    chords are fading in. Filter pings are providing clicky drums while white noise from the Moog DFAM
                    is playing a polyrhythmic snare. Pitch shifting echoes and a dreamy reverb are gluing the sounds
                    together. It makes you remember the past and think about the future. Just like memories do.
