                <article class="columns-3">
                    <p>
                        For the opening track “Sandstones” he used field recordings that he took at the sandstone
                        mountains of Saxony Switzerland National Park while hiking during the pandemic. Back in the
                        studio he layered it on top of spicy chords, beautiful pads and a shuffling groove. But it is
                        this melancholic organ that gives big emotions to the track.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second track is named after a famous little bass synthesizer. “Volca Dub” was recorded 10
                        years ago. It was waiting on the hard drive for the perfect moment to get finished and released.
                        The chords of the Korg Volca Bass are heavily modulated and tranched into swirling tape delays
                        with a rumbling sub bass underneath. Just like dub should sound.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final track “Everlasting” he recorded live in one take on his modular synthesizer. It starts
                        with the rolling bassline by a Buchla inspired dual oscillator. A dreamy melody and melancholic
                        chords are fading in. Filter pings are providing clicky drums while white noise from the Moog
                        DFAM is playing a polyrhythmic snare. Pitch shifting echoes and a dreamy reverb are gluing the
                        sounds together. It makes you remember the past and think about the future. Just like memories
                        do.
