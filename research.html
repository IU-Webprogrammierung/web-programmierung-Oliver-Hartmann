                        Always wanting to enhance my skills I attended to FELD workshop with Ulf Langheinrich at
                        ICAS festival 2015. For DAVE Festival I organized DAVE Workshop Camp with Electric Indigo,
                        Thomas Wagensommerer and Robert Henke at University of Music in Dresden 2017 and 2018. In 2024
                        Hellerau - Center of European Arts invited me to a workshop about 3D scanning objects using
                        LIDAR scanners to find the
                        <cite>digital me.</cite>

                    <p>
                        In 2022 I started studying media informatics at IU Internationale Hochschule. As part of my
                        studies, I did a project on user interface design about DAVE Festival website. I also looked
                        at the influence of AI on music and the influence of music streaming on mental healt of music
                        listeners.
                        For 2025 I was invited to write a book
                        article on <cite>How to Bandcamp, Spotify and YouTube - Basics of digital music
                            distribution.</cite> The book has been published on Springer / Gabler at the end of 2025.

                        As part of the DAVE Festival in November 2025, Anika Jankowski of Oh My Music! and I discussed
                        with the audience what an ideal platform for music streaming of the future might look like.

                    <p>Listening to music has a positive influence on mental health. In contrast to the rather positive
                        view of music streaming from the perspective of music listeners, the picture is somewhat
                        different from the perspective of music creators. Topics such as dependence on playlist
                        placements, the generation and distribution of revenue, adaptation of music to the conditions of
                        the platforms and new listening habits are discussed.

                <h2>Book Article: Basic Of digital Music distribution</h2>
                <article class="columns-3">
                    <p>
                        There are many ways to distribute music digitally. Music consumption is increasingly shifting
                        towards usage rather than ownership. My article compares Spotify's streaming service with
                        Bandcamp's ‘fair trade music platform’ model and YouTube's Content ID system for recognising and
                        remunerating music recordings in videos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, digital music distribution offers music creators many opportunities to distribute
                        their music. The multitude of music platforms differ in terms of their exploitation models.
                        Music listeners are increasingly using streaming to consume music. Although this can generate
                        revenue in the long term, success depends on factors such as placement in playlists or the music
                        platform's distribution model.</p>
                    <p>Bandcamp offers an alternative with its ‘Fairtrade
                        Music Policy’. As a video platform, YouTube not only offers
                        opportunities for the visual presentation of music, but also provides rights exploitation
                        through participation in advertising revenue with its Content ID.

                        The article has been published in the book 'Vermarktungsstrategien für digitale Medien' at

            <section aria-label="The Influence of music streaming on mental health of music listeners">
                <h2>The Influence of music streaming on mental health of music listeners</h2>
                <article class="columns-3">
                    <p>
                        Music is a cultural asset enjoyed by many people around the world. Listening to music can have
                        both positive and negative effects on physical health. Music consumption is increasingly taking
                        place via streaming. The effects of music streaming on a person's mental health depend on the
                        context, musical experiences and preferences, and well-being. Important features of music
                        streaming are the extensive music catalogue of music platforms, barrier-free access and constant
                        availability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the coronavirus pandemic, many people used music streaming to reduce anxiety, stress or
                        depression. Live video streams of concerts gained in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic
                        as they created a stronger sense of community and counteracted loneliness.
                    </p>
                    <p>Algorithmic playlists enable access to music based on mood and personal preferences. Sensors and
                        remote services can be used to collect data from the environment to generate context-based
                        playlists. The analysis of well-being, preferences and context-based data is increasingly based
                        on AI. However, not all users are aware of the use of AI on music platforms, and it presents
                        various challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Extensive listening can exacerbate a negative state of mind. Malfunctions or unexpected
                        behaviour of the technology can also have a negative impact on well-being and mental health.
                        Users have also reported a risk of addiction.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The findings of studies on the effects of music streaming on mental health during the
                        coronavirus pandemic offer a field of research. The question arises as to how the findings can
                        be used in music therapy to develop digital treatment methods. One research question could
                        specifically examine the use of playlists in music therapy. Another research question could
                        examine the applicability of the musical experiences of music listeners to other crises.
                        Furthermore, the conditions for experiencing a state of flow while streaming could be
                        investigated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Further research is needed to examine the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic on music
                        consumption and its possible consequences not only on individual health but also in a societal
                        context. One research question could be how culture and music consumption
                        behaviour has changed after the coronavirus pandemic. These findings can also serve as a
                        starting point for the cultural and music industry to create new and interesting cultural and
                        music offerings in both the offline and online worlds.
